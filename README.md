# Module-14

Overview: For this challenge, the index.html file is located in the main branch of my repository. The js script is located inside the static folder. Inside that static folder, there is a folder named js which inside contains my javascript file name app.js. The resources I used to help me write this code was class recordings and Instructor Drew's speed run. I mainly used MDN Web Docs, Observable, and Plotly Documentation. I also used Chart.js to help me with my javascript code.
